# Exploring-Oklahomas-Expenditures
Here I explore Oklahoma's state government's expenditures.

I start by understanding the fund types the government uses and check how often each one is used. 
I then check the amount of money that was associated with each type of fund and turn them into percentages

I then check to see the amount of different agencies that are recieving funds and how much each agency is receiving

The amount spent on public schools compared to higher education seemed intresting. 
So I calculated the amount spent on public schools and compared it to the amount spent on higher education and displayed the difference. 

I then attempt using the sklearn library in order to build a regression model. My Y variables are the amount of money spent and my x is time.
I was unable to understand how to use the library, so I built my own function which calculates a line of best for data using the least squares method.
